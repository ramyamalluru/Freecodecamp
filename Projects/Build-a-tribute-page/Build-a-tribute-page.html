          <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was born to Jainulabdeen and Ashiamma on October 15, 1931. He came from a family whose financial conditions weren’t sound enough. As a means to support his family’s meagre income, Kalam took up odd jobs in his childhood but never gave up on his education.
</li>
          <li>He graduated from Saint Joseph's College, Tiruchirappalli in 1954 but not satisfied with his degree, he left for Madras later next year to study aerospace engineering. He enrolled at the Madras Institute of Technology (MIT)
</li>
          <li>After graduating from MIT, Kalam took up the position of chief scientist at the Aeronautical Development Establishment of Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO). However, the profile didn’t appeal Kalam much who shifted to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle.
</li>
          <li>His years at the ISRO were the most crucial ones, as they left a lasting impact on him. Kalam lead many projects and turned out to be successful each time.
</li>
          <li>Here, Dr Kalam was regarded as the master brain of India’s missile project. For Kalam, hard work and determination was the key to his success</li>

    <li>Dr Kalam finally came into power in 2002 as the 11th President of India with much support across the government and the nation.</li>
    <li>He was always keen to utilise any opportunity he had during his five years of addressing the youth and students, and made himself far more reachable to the people than any other president has.</li>
    <li>As well as his prominent careers as both a scientist and president, Dr Kalam authored several books of non-fiction and biographical works. He even showed a special love for writing poetry. His non-fiction was primarily composed of manifestos for India in the wake of her future.</li>
    <li>The book, India 2020: A Vision for the New Millennium was engineered to be a wakeup call to all Indians to come and join hands and make India a developed nation by 2020 or before. He strongly advocated the importance of knowledge in the way of discovery and success.</li>
    <li>He wrote his autobiography, Wings of Fire, which tells readers about unlocking their inner potential. He elaborates his own life journey in detail, particularly how he kindled and kept the fire alive within himself</li>
    
    <li>Some of his other inspiring books include, The Luminous Sparks, Mission India and Inspiring Thoughts.</li>
    <li>To me the line which separated Dr. Kalam from the rest was not just his knowledge. It was his sensitivity and humility.</li>
    <li>Kalam was the proud recipient of Padma Bhushan, Padma Vibhushan and Bharat Ratna awards from the Government of India. He received the same in the years 1981, 1990 and 1997, respectively.
</li>
    <li>The Alwars Research Centre, Chennai, bestowed Kalam with Ramanujan Award in the year 2000.
</li>
    <li>The California Institute of Technology, U.S.A, presented Kalam with the International von Karman Wings Award in the year 2009. The same year, he won the Hoover Medal by ASME Foundation, USA.
</li>
    <li>Kalam was the proud recipient of honorary doctorates from 40 universities.
